# LA Jobs: Precise Pathway Mapping + Bias Analysis

As a submission for the [Data Science for Good: City of Los Angeles](https://www.kaggle.com/c/data-science-for-good-city-of-los-angeles/overview) Kaggle competition, I introduce a high-precision program that automatically visualizes the promotional pathways available for current city employees with only raw text job postings. I use this pathway data, LA job applicant diversity figures, and t-SNE dimensionality reduction to assess sources of bias that could discourage a diverse and talented new generation of civil servants in Los Angeles.

For a full explanation of the results refer to the [full kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/gbwalker/la-jobs-precise-pathway-mapping-bias-analysis), which won 5th place out of 115, or fork the repo to replicate.
